Code Examples
#############

One of the best ways to learn how to use a new tool is to look at
examples. The examples given in this manual were adapted from
real-life MMTK applications. They are also contained in the
MMTK distribution (directory "Examples") for direct use and modification.

The example molecules, system sizes, parameters, etc.,
were chosen to reduce execution time as much as possible, in order to
enable you to run the examples interactively step by step to see how
they work. If you plan to modify an example program for your own use,
don't forget to check all parameters carefully to make sure that you
obtain reasonable results.
