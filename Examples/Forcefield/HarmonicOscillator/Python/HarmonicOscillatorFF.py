# Each force field term requires two classes. One represents the
# abstract force field (HarmonicOscillator in this example), it knows
# nothing about any molecular system to which it might be applied.
# The other one (HarmonicOscillatorTerm) stores all the parameters required
# for energy evaluation, and provides the actual code.
#
# When a force field is evaluated for the first time for a given universe,
# the method evaluatorTerms() of the force field is called. It creates
# the EnergyTerm objects. The method evaluate() of the energy term object
# is called for every energy evaluation. Consequently, as much of the
# computation as possible should be done outside of this method.
